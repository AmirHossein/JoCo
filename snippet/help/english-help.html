					<p>JoCo allow you to manage comments of your site which create by <b>Jot</b> snippet.
					<br />The administrators <small>(role=1)</small> can set permissions for other managers except other administrators. they can hide some parts of this snippet for managers so if you have been limited by permissions, you won't see all parts. It has some parts that you would read descriptions below,</p>
					
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					
					<h3>Main frame</h3>
					<div>
						<p>You can see several links below the JoCo logo, these links let you choose that what kind of comments you want to see now.<br />
						JoCo uses your last login time and let you see comments that have created from this time. by click on <b>Last comments</b>, you will get this comments and <b>My Comments</b> link gets you all your comments in the site too.
						</p>
						<p>There is a tiny part on the top of frame that allow you to change the <b>theme</b>. if you select <b>Compressed</b>, you will see more comments in the screen. it is good to manage many comments in one page.</p>
						<br />
						after the links you see rows of comments. every row has some detaile:
						<ul>
							<li>comment title or subject has placed on eash row header or top bar.</li>
							<br />
							<li>on another side, you see AJAX button,
								<ul>
									<li>comment will <b>Publish</b> on click on <img src="[+sniPath+]images/publish.png" /> button.</li>
									<li>comment will <b>Unpublish</b> on click on <img src="[+sniPath+]images/unpublish.png" /> button.</li>
									<li>comment will <b>Delete</b> on click on <img src="[+sniPath+]images/delete.png" /> button.</li>

							<br />
							<li>You see the message and probably a colorless word which indicates that comments is published or unpublished </li>
							<br />
							<li>in other side, there is checkboxes to do actions on more comments.</li>
							<br />
							<li>after all comment rows, there is <b>Submit</b> button that do actions that you choose by checking comment checkboxes.</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<p>User will not see the comments which are in documents that he/she can not access to them (documents in docgroups that user has no permissions to access them).</p>
						<p>The comments with a little different style are user's own commnets.</p>
